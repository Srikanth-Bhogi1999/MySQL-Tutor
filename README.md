Introduction - 

Every student who wanted to learn a MySQL language faces difficulty to understand & write proper syntax\n
which is time taking because of un-proper tutoring. We have taken this project to make  beginners\n
free from fear and misconceptions. Our application takes the errors made by the user & performs\n
analysis based on the output or error produced after their compilation and prepares resourceful\n
feedback. It makes users learn from their mistakes effectively. In addition to this, our\n
system lets the user write a command by dividing it into parts, and thereby the user gets a clear\n
idea. There will be few lists of tasks assigned to them to perform execution in the query language.\n
We had faced similar problems when we were beginners to the query language and learning MySQL.\n
We had taken a survey from the group of people who were willing to learn MySQL, the conclusions are\n
Major problem faced by them was knowing right syntax, it is the most important thing. Many people can't\n
able to understand MySQL generated error. Every student who tries to learn a MySQL language face\n
difficulty to understand and write proper syntax which is time taking because of un-proper tutoring.\n
Our team decided to develop a system to overcome the problems that many beginners faced in learning\n
Query language using MySQL.
